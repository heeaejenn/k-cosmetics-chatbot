2023 Year-End Review Mask Pack Category

As for the beauty industry trends,
the first is the decline of road shop brands
This may sound a bit harsh
but it reflects the current situation where road shop brands are facing
increasing difficulties due to the post-COVID-19 era
The road shop brands that decorated the 2000s and 2010s with splendor include
A’pieu, MISSHA, ETUDE, innisfree, SKINFOOD
It's a bit nostalgic as these brands are fading away
giving a sense of 'memories' and 'nostalgia’
Road shop brands have had to make changes in their direction by reducing product offerings
and cutting advertising expenses due to declining sales
They are also reviving through methods like online market strategies commonly used by online brands
or focusing on one 'star product'
or collaborating more frequently
This is the current situation
Despite these efforts, it seems that road shop brands may not be able to avoid decline in 2024
The reason for this is the strong presence of major players in the industry like Olive Young
and the emergence of cost-effective brands like Daiso cosmetics
Personally, I hope that road shop brands, as mid-range brands
can carve out a specific niche and continue to contribute to the cosmetics industry and market
2023 Year-End Review Lotion Category

There are often questions about whether to use lotion or moisturizing cream
The key difference between the two lies in their moisture retention abilities
Moisturizing creams tend to be oilier and have a thicker consistency
while lotions are lighter and have a lower oil content
It’s essential to choose one based on your skin type
You don't need to apply both
After using toner, you can choose either lotion or moisturizing cream

The beauty keyword here is "cost-effectiveness"
Given the economic challenges we've been facing this year and expected to continue into the next
more consumers are looking to buy products at affordable prices
rather than focusing solely on functionality
There are many people buying cosmetics for a few thousand won on AliExpress
but it's essential to note that not all inexpensive products are good
To truly represent good value, a product should offer quality ingredients, good formulation
and product quality that matches its price.
In Korea, brands like Clio, The Saem, and Too Cool for School have collaborated extensively with Daiso
They offer similar products at lower price points through Daiso
However, it's crucial to scrutinize the ingredients and composition
to determine whether these products truly match their price points
We recommend evaluating the quality of the product relative to its price before making a purchase
